# Martingale-Risk-of-Ruin
# Martingale Betting Strategy Simulator

This Python script simulates the Martingale betting strategy, a popular gambling strategy where the bet is doubled after each loss until a win occurs, at which point the bet is reset to the initial amount.

## Usage

### Instructions

1. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python martingale.py <start_amount> <starting_bet> <multiplier> <bet_multiplier> <max_profit>
   ```

   Replace `<start_amount>`, `<starting_bet>`, `<multiplier>`, `<bet_multiplier>`, and `<max_profit>` with appropriate values. For example:

   ```bash
   python martingale.py 1000 10 2 2 10000
   ```
